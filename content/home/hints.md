The Help through INTelligent Support (HINTS) Lab, directed by Dr. Thomas Price, works to develop learning environments that automatically support students with AI and data-driven help features. With a focus on computing education, our goal is to reimagine programming environments as adaptive, interactive systems that help students to pursue learning goals that are meaningful to them. We believe that every student should be able to learn computing with the support they need to be successful, working on projects that match their values and interests. Our research emphasizes practical methods that can scale to new classrooms and contexts, without placing additional burden on instructors. Examples of our research include:

* Supporting students to design and implement on open-ended programming projects.
* Generating data-driven programming help, such as hints and worked examples.
* Developing machine learning models to better understand student code and predict learning outcomes.
* Understanding how programmers seek and use help from web-based help, AI systems, and humans.
* Evaluating the impact of programming support in classroom and lab studies.
<!-- * Developing standards for benchmarking the quality of data-driven support -->
<!-- * Enhancing block-based and novice programming environments that enable creative computation -->
