abstract: "In this paper, we explore the impact of two types of instruc- tional interventions,\
  \ worked examples and problem solving, at two levels of granularity: problems and\
  \ steps. This study drew on an existing Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for Probabil-\
  \ ity called Pyrenees and involved 266 students who were ran- domly assigned to\
  \ five conditions. All students experienced the same procedure, studied the same\
  \ training problems in the same order, and used the same ITS. The conditions differed\
  \ only in how the training problems were presented. Our re- sults showthat when\
  \ the domain content and required steps are strictly equivalent, different granularities\
  \ of pedagogical deci- sions can significantly impact students' time on task. More\
  \ specifically, the fine-grained step level decisions can have a stronger pedagogical\
  \ impact than the problem-level ones. Keywords:"
