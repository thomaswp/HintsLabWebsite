abstract: Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions
  or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic
  product is \"any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with
  the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to
  cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors
  and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions\". However, science advancement
  in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which
  many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the
  skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products
  as \"cosmeceuticals\", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
  Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called
  cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying,
  for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating
  the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity
  of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical
  or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or
  mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the
  other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals
  which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or
  sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products
  are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category
  of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues,
  produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients
  and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective,
  whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently
  from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors,
  and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining
  in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into
  the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier,
  has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and
  anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they
  give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review
  part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable
  cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.
