abstract: In the domain of programming, intelligent tutoring systems increasingly
  employ data-driven methods to automate hint generation. Evaluations of these systems
  have largely focused on whether they can reliably provide hints for most students,
  and how much data is needed to do so, rather than how useful the resulting hints
  are to students. We present a method for evaluating the quality of data-driven hints
  and how their quality is impacted by the data used to generate them. Using two datasets,
  we investigate how the quantity of data and the source of data (whether it comes
  from students or experts) impact one hint generation algorithm. We find that with
  student training data, hint quality stops improving after 15â€“20 training solutions
  and can decrease with additional data. We also find that student data outperforms
  a single expert solution but that a comprehensive set of expert solutions generally
  performs best.
