abstract: 'In this study a model of question answering (called QUEST) is tested in
  the context of short stories. College students first read a story and then judged
  the quality of answers to questions about episodes in the story. The model could
  account for the goodness-of-answer judgments and decision latencies of 5 categories
  of questions: why, how, when, enablement, and consequence. QUEST specifies the information
  sources that are activated during question answering; the content of each information
  source is structured according to a theory of knowledge representation. QUEST specifies
  the convergence processes that dramatically narrow down the set of possible answers
  (activated from the information sources) to a small set of good answers to a question.'
