abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems can support students in solving multi-step
  tasks by providing a hint regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step
  hints manually or using an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible
  states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step
  hints automatically, relying on past student's data. Such hints typically have the
  form of an edit which could have been performed by capable students in the given
  situation, based on what past capable students have done. In this contribution we
  provide a mathematical framework to analyze edit-based hint policies and, based
  on this theory, propose a novel hint
