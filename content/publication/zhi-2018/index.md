abstract: "Instructional supports (Supports) help students learn more effectively\
  \ in intelligent tutoring systems and gamified educational environments. However,\
  \ the implementation and success of Supports vary by environment. We explored Support\
  \ design in an educational programming game, BOTS, implementing three different\
  \ strategies: instructional text (Text), worked examples (Examples) and buggy code\
  \ (Bugs). These strategies are adapted from promising Supports in other domains\
  \ and motivated by established educational theory. We evaluated our Supports through\
  \ a pilot study with middle school students. Our results suggest Bugs may be a promising\
  \ strategy, as demonstrated by the lower completion time and solution code length\
  \ in assessment puzzles. We end reflecting on our design decisions providing recommendations\
  \ for future iterations. Our motivations, design process, and study's results provide\
  \ insight into the design of Supports for programming games."
