abstract: Frame-based editing is a novel way to edit programs, which claims to combine
  the benefits of textual and block-based programming. It combines structured ‘frames'
  of prefor- matted code, designed to reduce the burden of syntax, with ‘slots' that
  allow for efficient textual entry of expressions. We present an empirical evaluation
  of Stride, a frame-based language used in theGreenfoot IDE.We compare two groups
  of middle school students who worked on a short program- ming activity in Greenfoot,
  one using the original Java edi- tor, and one using the Stride editor. We found
  that the two groups reported similarly low levels of frustration and high levels
  of satisfaction, but students using Stride progressed through the activity more
  quickly and completed more ob- jectives. The Stride group also spent significantly
  less time making purely syntactic edits to their code and significantly less time
  with non-compilable code.
