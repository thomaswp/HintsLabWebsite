I want to understand the cognitive, psychological, and social journeys a students takes to become a programmer, and build tools to support such development. I believe programming support should be natural, simple, and should be helping all kinds of learners. As I’m currently in my second year, I am focusing on learning and exploring methods and ideas in code analysis and student programming experience that create research space for promoting novices’ programming self-efficacy and creativity.
Before joining HINTS Lab, I did my undergraduate study in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.
