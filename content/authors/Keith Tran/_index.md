As a first-year Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, Keith's research interest involves scaling intervention in CS education and promoting active learning in computing education. He is currently working on a project to survey tool developers in the computer science education community, aiming to understand the challenges faced in classroom adoption and to build a supportive infrastructure for future programming support tools. Additionally, Keith is involved in a research project exploring the landscape of open-access datasets in the computing education domain, addressing the existing gap in understanding the types of data represented and those that are not.
