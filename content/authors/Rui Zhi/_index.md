Rui is interested in motivating students in learning programming concepts by applying cognitive science theories. Rui’s research investigates the impact of programming worked examples on students performance, programming efficiency and learning. He has conducted studies on their efficacy in the BOTS education game and in the iSnap novice programming environment. He is currently working to develop novel data-driven methods to generate worked example steps automatically, which are customized to the student’s current code. Rui was co-advised by Dr. Tiffany Barnes in the Game2Learn lab.
