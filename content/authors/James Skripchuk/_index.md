James Skripchuk is a Ph.D. Candidate and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow at North Carolina State University. His research involves studying how novice programmers navigate and learn to use the external information-seeking tools used by professional programmers. These tools range from documentation pages and Q&A websites to cutting-edge AI code generation tools and large language models. By understanding how novices use these tools, James aims to design effective pedagogy for “learning how to learn” in the rapidly changing landscape of programming. Outside of research, James considers himself a music nerd and enjoys creatively exploring the intersection of technology and sound.
