James is interested on how we can use data-driven methods to make learning Computer Science more accessible and authentic. During his undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware, he co-designed the course “Computational Thinking in Music”, in which non-STEM majors used statistical methods and CS skills to compose a song in the style of their favorite artist. James’ current research is investigating how students learn and conceptualize machine learning models. In addition to this, he is also interested in understanding how novice programmers seek for help on the Internet when they are stuck.
