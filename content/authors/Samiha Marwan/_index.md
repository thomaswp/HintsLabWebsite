Samiha is passionate about helping students learn how to code and improving students’ problem solving skills. Her research focuses on designing and evaluating different design choices of automated support, particularly next-step hints and formative feedback, to improve students’ cognitive outcomes (e.g. performance and learning), and affective outcomes (e.g. motivation and persistence). Samiha's PhD research resulted in a system that provides enhanced next-step hints that have been shown to improve students' performance, and a system that provide adaptive immediate formative feedback that has been shown to improve students' performance, motivation, and persistence. Samiha has been awarded a CI-Fellowship award and will start her post-doc in Spring 2022. Her future work will focus on the development of instructional designs to improve students' subgoals decomposition skills in programming classrooms.
