**Current NCSU Ph.D. Students:** If you are interested in working with us, please feel free to reach out:

1.  Take a look at my [projects page](http://hintslab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/projects/) and think about what project(s) you might be interested in working on.
2.  Send me an email ([twprice@ncsu.edu](mailto:twprice@ncsu.edu)) with some details about yourself, including your program (PhD or Masters), year, goals, resume/CV and research interests.
