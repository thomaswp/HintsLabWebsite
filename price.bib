@phdthesis{MarwanThesis,
abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

abstract = {Modeling student learning processes is highly complex since it is influenced by many factors such as motivation and learning habits. The high volume of features and tools provided by computer-based learning environments confounds the task of tracking student knowledge even further. Deep Learning models such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) and classic Markovian models such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) have been successfully applied for student modeling. However, much of this prior work is designed to handle sequences of events with discrete timesteps, rather than considering the continuous aspect of time. Given that time elapsed between successive elements in a student's tra-jectory can vary from seconds to days, we applied a Time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to model the dynamics of student knowledge state in continuous time. We investigate the effectiveness of T-LSTM on two domains with very different characteristics. One involves an open-ended programming environment where students can self-pace their progress and T-LSTM is compared against LSTM, Recent Temporal Pattern Mining, and the classic Logistic Regression (LR) on the early prediction of student success; the other involves a classic tutor-driven intelligent tutoring system where the tutor scaffolds the student learning step by step and T-LSTM is compared with LSTM, LR, and BKT on the early prediction of student learning gains. Our results show that T-LSTM significantly outperforms the other methods on the self-paced, open-ended programming environment; while on the tutor-driven ITS, it ties with LSTM and outperforms both LR and BKT. In other words, while time-irregularity exists in both datasets, T-LSTM works significantly better than other student models when the pace is driven by students. On the other hand, when such irregularity results from the tutor, T-LSTM was not superior to other models but its performance was not hurt either.},

abstract = {In the domain of programming, a growing number of algorithms automatically generate data-driven, next-step hints that suggest how students should edit their code to resolve errors and make progress. While these hints have the potential to improve learning if done well, few evaluations have directly assessed or compared the quality of different hint generation approaches. In this work, we present the QualityScore procedure, a novel method for automatically evaluating and comparing the quality of next-step programming hints. We first demonstrate that the automated QualityScore ratings agree with experts' manual ratings. We then use the QualityScore procedure to compare the quality of 6 data-driven, next-step hint generation algorithms using two distinct programming datasets in two different programming languages. Our results show that there are large and significant differences between the quality of the 6 algorithms and that these differences are relatively consistent across datasets and problems. We also identify situations where the six algorithms struggle to produce high-quality hints, and we suggest ways that future work might address these gaps in quality hint coverage.},

abstract = {A growing body of work has explored how to automatically generate hints for novice programmers, and many programming environments now employ these hints. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of automated programming hints for improving performance and learning, how and when novices find these hints beneficial, and the tradeoffs that exist between different types of hints. In this work, we explored the efficacy of next-step code hints with 2 complementary features: textual explanations and self-explanation prompts. We conducted two studies in which novices completed two programming tasks in a block-based programming environment with automated hints. In Study 1, 10 undergraduate students completed 2 programming tasks with a variety of hint types, and we interviewed them to understand their perceptions of the affordances of each hint type. For Study 2, we recruited a convenience sample of participants without programming experience from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We conducted a randomized experiment comparing the effects of hints' types on learners' performance and performance on a subsequent task without hints. We found that code hints with textual explanations significantly improved immediate programming performance. However, these hints only improved performance in a subsequent post-test task with similar objectives, when they were combined with self-explanation prompts. These results provide design insights into how automatically generated code hints can be improved with textual explanations and prompts to self-explain, and provide evidence about when and how these hints can improve programming performance and learning.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems can support students in solving multi-step tasks by providing a hint regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step hints manually or using an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step hints automatically, relying on past student's data. Such hints typically have the form of an edit which could have been performed by capable students in the given situation, based on what past capable students have done. In this contribution we provide a mathematical framework to analyze edit-based hint policies and, based on this theory, propose a novel hint},

These strategies are adapted from promising Supports in other domains and motivated by established educational theory. We evaluated our Supports through a pilot study with middle school students. Our results suggest Bugs may be a promising strategy, as demonstrated by the lower completion time and solution code length in assessment puzzles. We end reflecting on our design decisions providing recommendations for future iterations.

Evaluations of these systems have largely focused on whether they can reliably provide hints for most students, and how much data is needed to do so, rather than how useful the resulting hints are to students. We present a method for evaluating the quality of data-driven hints and how their quality is impacted by the data used to generate them. Using two datasets, we investigate how the quantity of data and the source of data (whether it comes from students or experts) impact one hint generation algorithm. We find that with student training data, hint quality stops improving after 15–20 training solutions and can decrease with additional data. We also find that student data outperforms a single expert solution but that a comprehensive set of expert solutions generally performs best.},

abstract = {Frame-based editing is a novel way to edit programs, which claims to combine the benefits of textual and block-based programming. It combines structured ‘frames' of prefor- matted code, designed to reduce the burden of syntax, with ‘slots' that allow for efficient textual entry of expressions. We present an empirical evaluation of Stride, a frame-based language used in theGreenfoot IDE.We compare two groups of middle school students who worked on a short program- ming activity in Greenfoot, one using the original Java edi- tor, and one using the Stride editor. We found that the two groups reported similarly low levels of frustration and high levels of satisfaction, but students using Stride progressed through the activity more quickly and completed more ob- jectives. The Stride group also spent significantly less time making purely syntactic edits to their code and significantly less time with non-compilable code.},

abstract = {In this study a model of question answering (called QUEST) is tested in the context of short stories. College students first read a story and then judged the quality of answers to questions about episodes in the story. The model could account for the goodness-of-answer judgments and decision latencies of 5 categories of questions: why, how, when, enablement, and consequence. QUEST specifies the information sources that are activated during question answering; the content of each information source is structured according to a theory of knowledge representation. QUEST specifies the convergence processes that dramatically narrow down the set of possible answers (activated from the information sources) to a small set of good answers to a question.},

abstract = {Model-based tutoring systems are driven by an abstract do- main model and solver that is used for solution validation and student guidance. Such models are robust but costly to produce and are not always adaptive to specific students' needs. Data-driven methods such as the Hint Factory are comparatively cheaper and can be used to generate indi- vidualized hints without a complete domain model. In this paper we explore the application of data-driven hint analy- sis of the type used in the Hint Factory to existing model- based systems. We present an analysis of two probability tutors Andes and Pyrenees. The former allows for flexible problem-solving while the latter scaffolds students' solution path. We argue that the state-space analysis can be used to better understand students' problem-solving strategies and can be used to highlight the impact of different design de- cisions. We also demonstrate the potential for data-driven hint generation across systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the impact of two types of instruc- tional interventions, worked examples and problem solving, at two levels of granularity: problems and steps. This study drew on an existing Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for Probabil- ity called Pyrenees and involved 266 students who were ran- domly assigned to five conditions. All students experienced the same procedure, studied the same training problems in the same order, and used the same ITS. The conditions differed only in how the training problems were presented. Our re- sults showthat when the domain content and required steps are strictly equivalent, different granularities of pedagogical deci- sions can significantly impact students' time on task. More specifically, the fine-grained step level decisions can have a stronger pedagogical impact than the problem-level ones. Keywords:},
